# Data Collection and Cleaning

In this week, we will focus on collecting and cleaning the data. The data will be provided as a link for download only. 

1. Loading the Data
Insight: Ensures that the dataset is properly loaded and available for analysis. This is fundamental for any further analysis. Any issues here could indicate data corruption or formatting problems that need to be addressed.
2. Data Overview
Insight: Provides a glimpse into the dataset structure, including the number of records, types of variables, and basic statistics. Understanding the shape and types of data (e.g., numerical, categorical) helps in determining suitable analysis techniques.
3. Missing Values Check
Insight: Identifying missing values allows for informed decisions on how to handle them (e.g., imputation or removal). This step ensures data quality, which is critical for accurate sentiment analysis.
4. Data Distribution
Insight: Understanding the distribution of key variables (like ratings and sentiment polarity) helps identify patterns, such as whether ratings are skewed toward positive or negative ends. This can indicate general customer satisfaction levels.
5. Sentiment Analysis
Insight: Calculating sentiment scores (polarity and subjectivity) offers quantitative measures of customer sentiment. This step provides a more nuanced understanding of how customers feel about products or services, beyond simple ratings.
6. Sentiment Distribution
Insight: Visualizing the distribution of sentiment scores helps assess the overall sentiment of the reviews. For instance, if most sentiments are positive, it indicates favorable customer experiences. Conversely, a negative skew might suggest issues with the product or service.
7. Review Length Analysis
Insight: Analyzing the length of reviews (word count) can reveal trends about customer engagement. Longer reviews may indicate higher levels of engagement or sentiment intensity, while very short reviews could be less informative.
8. Sentiment Over Time (if applicable)
Insight: Even without explicit timestamps, looking at sentiment changes over reviews can help infer trends in customer satisfaction. For example, if reviews improve over time, it may indicate effective changes in product quality or service.
9. Common Words in Reviews
Insight: Identifying frequently used words in positive and negative reviews provides qualitative insights into what aspects customers appreciate or dislike. This can highlight specific features or issues with a product or service.
10. Correlation Between Ratings and Sentiment
Insight: Analyzing the correlation between ratings and sentiment scores helps validate the effectiveness of the sentiment analysis approach. A strong positive correlation would indicate that higher ratings are typically associated with positive sentiment, affirming the reliability of the analysis.
Conclusion
These steps together create a comprehensive picture of customer sentiment. The insights gained can guide product development, marketing strategies, and customer service improvements by understanding what drives customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction.
